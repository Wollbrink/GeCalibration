Lists information about about the High Voltage and Amplifier and other settings

Reads in a text file of the ASCII data from Maestro and bins the data to a TH1D histogram

Searches the histogram for gamma peaks.

Peak locations are modified by fitting a crystal ball function, which gives a new mean and standard deviation.
